I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the [Department of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Science (EOAS)](https://www.eoas.fsu.edu/) at [Florida State University (FSU)](https://www.fsu.edu/). I am advised by [Dr. Henry Fuelberg](https://atmos.eoas.fsu.edu/fuelberg/autobiography/). My research focuses on how different convective regimes transport boundary-layer chemicals to the upper troposphere/ lower stratosphere (UTLS) region within the updrafts of deep convective storms. I received an M.S. (2023) in Meteorology from FSU on the simulating vertical transport of chemicals within deep convection using a parameterized chemistry coupled atmospheric model (WRF-Chem) under the advisement of Professor Henry Fuelberg, and a B.S. in Meteorological Engineering from [Istanbul Technical University (ITU)](https://www.itu.edu.tr/en) in 2021 under the advisement of Professor Yurdanur Unal. My B.S. thesis was on the climatological extreme precipitation analysis of Turkey using different gridded products (ERA5-Land/IMERG/NEWA-WRF) and comparison with observations.

I am originally from Turkey and enjoy painting, biking, and cooking. Please contact me if you have any questions about the graduate program at Florida State, my research, life as a graduate student, being an international student at FSU, or anything else!
