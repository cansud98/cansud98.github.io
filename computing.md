My research uses local computing and supercomputing resources.

The Florida State University HPC system features over 18,000 and over 700 nodes providing powerful and scalable HPC resources. My research utilizes the FSU HPC for numerical simulations and data processing related to mesoscale storm modeling.

This webpage contains information about how to set up and run WRF on FSU HPC.


# Introduction

This guide is prepared to facilitate the basic compilation and execution of WRF-ARW v4.3.3 on FSU HPC. (I will update this page for the new releases of WRF-ARW). For detailed installing and running options beyond this guide, please see: ![WRF User’s Guide -- (ucar.edu)](https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/wrf_users_guide/build/html/index.html)

Before reading the rest of the guide, I recommend reading the ![FSU HPC Overview & Using the HPC ](https://docs.rcc.fsu.edu/hpc/).
