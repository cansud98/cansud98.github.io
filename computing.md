My research uses local computing and supercomputing resources.

The Florida State University HPC system features over 18,000 and over 700 nodes providing powerful and scalable HPC resources. My research utilizes the FSU HPC for numerical simulations and data processing related to mesoscale storm modeling.

This webpage contains information about how to set up and run WRF on FSU HPC.
