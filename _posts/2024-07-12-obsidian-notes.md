## Note #1
Obsidian is a note-taking application that you can download and install directly from its ![website](https://obsidian.md/) as a desktop app. You create files called "vaults," which are essentially folders on your desktop. Each "vault" should contain notes on a specific topic to keep your notes organized. For example, when doing literature research for your thesis, you can use `[[ ]]` to link your notes together. You can view the relationships between your notes as a graph.

## Note #2: The 6 Most Important Markdown Keys
1. **The Link** ⇒ `[[something]]`
2. **The Tag** ⇒ `#concept` (you can search for tags: `#concept`)
3. **Italics** ⇒ *emphasize something* (single asterisks)
4. **Bold** ⇒ **Big Nouns** (double asterisks)
5. **Lists** ⇒ Just put a dash and leave a blank, it’ll start a list (`- `); or number it.
6. **Headers** ⇒ `# Header-1`; `## Header-2`; `### Header-3`; … you can go further.

## Note #3: The 8 Most Important Settings in Obsidian
**Gall’s Law:** Gall’s Law states that all complex systems that work evolved from simpler systems that worked. If you want to build a complex system that works, build a simpler system first, and then improve it over time. [Josh Kaufman, personal MBA].

1. **Editor:** Spell check
2. **Plugin:** Tag Pane (this will create a list of tags)
3. **Plugin:** Page Preview
4. **Plugin:** Starred (I guess it is a bookmark)
5. **File:** Deleted files (goes to the system trash)
6. **File:** *Always update internal links*
7. **Appearance:** Dark/Light mode
8. **Appearance:** Custom CSS (special themes, will be explained in the next notes)

## Note #4: Custom CSS
### Base Mode
1. Dark
2. Light
3. Adapt to system

### Community Plugins
- Turn on
- Browse the ‘community plugins’
- Once you like a theme: download it and enable it
- I use ‘Excalidraw’ since you can draw in that template as well! But there are a lot of options, and if you’d like to create one, you can create your own template as well.
